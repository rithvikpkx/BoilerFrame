# BoilerFrame
My [LaunchPad Purdue](https://launchpadpurdue.com/) Project

## Description
Have you ever had to waste hours looking for someone in a long video? Let BoilerFrame find the exact timestamps and frames where they were shown! 

BoilerFrame is simple. All it takes is a video file and pictures of the target as input, and it finds the timestamps and exact frames where the target appears in the video.

The main reason I chose to develop this project at LaunchPad Purdue is because of my eagerness to learn web development. Being able to make my own web application and deploying it to the internet was always a goal of mine, and when I got accepted into LaunchPad Purdue I knew that this was the perfect oppurtunity to get started.

## Project Architecture

This project uses the MERN tech stack for the web app and the AWS Rekognition API for facial analysis of the videos.
